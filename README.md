# datom

Datom is pure positional typed data on the published Protos substrate. It
does not generate Rust; that belongs to Ethos. Protos owns lexical blocks,
shape vocabulary, string carriers, and the only structural walk. Datom adds
only context-sensitive typed realization and textual projection.

## Current typed surface

- `Report`, `Entry`, `Group`, `TagList`, `Text`, and `InterimNote` are the
  concrete positional models used by the registered design examples.
- `PathLock` is the native path-lock record: its `PathLockText` form is
  `PathLock.{name [paths] description}`. It realizes and textualizes through
  Protos directly, without a compatibility record. Its path list is nonempty;
  every path is absolute and canonicalizes repeated separators and `.`
  segments. Relative paths, `..` segments, and duplicate canonical paths are
  rejected. Names and descriptions are nonblank single lines.
  Construct it only through `PathLock::try_new` with
  `PathLockConstructing` in scope; `PathLockViewing` exposes its three
  validated values read-only.
- `PathLockRegistered` textualizes as
  `PathLockRegistered.{PathLock.{name [paths] description}}`.
  `PathLockRegistrationRejected` textualizes as
  `PathLockRegistrationRejected.{PathLock.{name [paths] description} reason}`.
  Its closed reasons are `DuplicateActiveName.{holder}` and
  `PathOverlap.{path holder}`; the latter carries a normalized absolute path.
- `ReportText`, `InterimNoteText`, and `PathLockText` are concrete typed
  textual carriers. They implement Protos `Realize`; their matching real types
  implement Protos `Textualize`.
- `EvidencedRealizing` and `EvidencedTextualizing` return those same typed
  values/texts paired with read-only transition evidence copied from the
  actual Protos driver; dialect code never owns or proxies `Walk`.
- Records read and write field positions only. Variants carry their Head;
  their payload is headless in its own context.
- Strings project bare exactly when the Protos scanner can carry the complete
  value as one bare block; otherwise they use parenthesis. Curly quotes are
  accepted as the legacy input carrier. Parenthesis projection preserves a
  trailing backslash, literal escaped parentheses, and balanced nested pairs.
  Meaning remains deferred to
  `structuredStringType.md` and bead `primary-xqb.8.5`.
- `Map.[north.[…]]` is a keyed vector entry with one structural Protos frame.
  Plain `Map.[kind.core]` is an unambiguous bare pair. Keys containing dots,
  and delimited keys followed by `.`, are deliberately unsupported pending a
  psyche ruling; they return a Datom fault rather than changing Protos.

Canonical text is a block projection, not preservation of original whitespace
or the legacy curly carrier spelling.
